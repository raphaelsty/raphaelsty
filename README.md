Hi ðŸ‘‹

Doing Research & Development @ LightOn. Prev. ManoMano & Renault.

I hold a PhD in Language Models, Information Retrieval and Knowledge Graphs.

Passionate about Search Engine, Recommender Systems, ML, LLM, VLM, [neural-cherche](https://github.com/raphaelsty/neural-cherche), [PyLate](https://github.com/lightonai/pylate), [Neural Tree](https://github.com/raphaelsty/neural-tree).

Strong interest for databases and SQL -> [ducksearch](https://github.com/lightonai/ducksearch).

Love fancy data visualization: [KG Search](https://github.com/raphaelsty/kgsearch).

Created RAG open-source tools before the hype: [cherche](https://github.com/raphaelsty/cherche).

My personal Search Engine is updated twice a day and is available @ [knowledge](https://raphaelsty.github.io/knowledge). 

Welcoming any contributions to those packages ðŸ¤—
